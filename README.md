This script will replace the CoreBrightness.framework with one already patched with the matching hex value in CoreBrightness.framework for most older/unsupported hardware.

# History

macOS Sierra 10.12.4 brings iOS's Night Shift mode to the Mac for the first time. Night Shift, first introduced on iOS devices in iOS 9.3, is designed to gradually shift the display of a device from blue to a subtle yellow, cutting down on exposure to blue light. Blue light is believed to interrupt the circadian rhythm, disrupting sleep patterns. 

Night Shift is activated through the Displays section of System Preferences, where a setting to have it come on at sunset and turn off at sunrise is available. It can also be set to turn on and off at custom times. Night Shift can also be toggled on manually using the Notification Center or Siri. 

Night Shift was introduced in macOS Sierra 10.12.4 (16E144f) and is controlled by the CoreBrightness.framework. The official minimum requirements for this feature are: 

- MacBookPro9,x
- iMacPro1,x
- iMac13,x
- Macmini6,x
- MacBookAir5,x
- MacPro6,x
- MacBook8,x

Of course, this patch is intended to bypass this check completely.

# OS Version Requirements

- macOS 10.12 Sierra Supported
- macOS 10.13 High Sierra Supported
- macOS 10.14 Mojave Supported
